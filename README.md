```

### View Receipt

To view a receipt, send a GET request to `/tickets/receipt/{email}` with the user's email address as a path variable.

Example:

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/tickets/receipt/john.doe@example.com
```

### Modify Seat

To modify a user's seat, send a PUT request to `/tickets/modify-seat` with the user's email address and the new seat number as query parameters.

Example:

```bash
curl -X PUT "http://localhost:8080/tickets/modify-seat?email=john.doe@example.com&newSeat=B5"
